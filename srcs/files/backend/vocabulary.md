# Vocabulary

 ## API Endpoint

- An API endpoint is like a special door 🚪 that allows different software systems to talk to each other. It's like a designated spot where you can go to get or send information. 📡

    -`Example`: Think of an API endpoint as a reception desk at a hotel. You go there to request a room key or ask for information about the hotel services.

## Route

- A **route** is like a roadmap 🗺️ that tells your program how to get to a specific place in the API. It's like a path or address that you follow to reach a particular destination.

   - **Example**: Imagine you are driving to a friend's house 🏡. The route is the set of directions you follow, such as "turn left at the traffic light, then go straight until you reach the second intersection."

## API Endpoint and Route (Together)

- Combining the two concepts, an API endpoint with a route is like a specific location that you visit through a particular path. It's like finding a hidden treasure chest 🎁 by following a map 🗺️.

    - **Example**: Let's say you want to log in to a website. You visit the "/api/login" endpoint (the treasure chest) by following the route (the map), which might be something like "https://example.com/api/login".

## **Remember**, the endpoint is the `destination` you want to reach, and the route is the `path` you follow to get there!
