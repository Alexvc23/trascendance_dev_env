    Dockerfile: This file contains the instructions for Docker to build your frontend application into a Docker image. This Docker image can then be run inside a Docker container.

    package.json: This file contains metadata about your application and its dependencies. Node.js uses this file to determine which packages to install for your application.

    public/: This directory contains static files that your app can serve. This is where files like index.html, favicon.ico, and any static assets would live. The index.html file is the main HTML document that is served when someone visits your app. It typically contains a div element where your React app will render.

    src/: This directory is where you'll write all of your React code. This is where components, utilities, hooks, context providers, and everything else that makes up your React application will live.

This structure makes it clear where different types of files should be. For example, developers working on the project know to look in src/ for React code and public/ for static assets. Separating concerns in this way makes the project easier to navigate and maintain.
